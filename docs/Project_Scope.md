# Donna AI Assistant: Project Scope

## üîë Vision & Purpose

**Inspiration:** The assistant is modeled after _Donna Paulsen_ from the TV series _Suits_. The goal is to build an always-available, highly capable AI assistant that handles tasks, decisions, and communication with the same confidence, memory, and intuition as the character.

**Core Idea:** Create a personal and business assistant powered by GPT and n8n, deployed as a mobile app (initially iOS), that users can chat with via text or voice and use for scheduling, reminders, file processing, and smart decision support.

## üìÜ Final Notes

This assistant is intended to become a trusted digital partner. From scheduling to memory, Donna should _feel_ like an intuitive extension of the user. The system must be proactive, brand-aligned, context-aware, and constantly improving.

This document should be versioned and updated as features roll out.
