# DAA Project Log

**Centralized log for AI agents on the Donna Assistant team**  
_Used for tracking sprint progress, system changes, agent status, blockers, and coordination notes._

---

## 🗓️ May 16, 2025 — Manual Entry

✅ **Completed**
- Initialized `/DAA_Core/DAA_ProjectLog.md` for multi-agent coordination
- Defined role scopes and instructions for: FlowMaster, UINikki, CopyGenie, MemoryBot, ScrumDonna
- Deployed working Firebase hosting environment at: `https://donna-assistant-b9ce3.web.app`
- Successfully linked custom domain `askdonna.app` via Porkbun
- Connected domain to Firebase project `donna-assistant-b9ce3`
- Issued SSL cert (status: active) and confirmed DNS TXT record propagation

🔄 **In Progress**
- Building assistant demo landing page (askdonna.app) using Tailwind + Vite
- Updating all agents to reflect transition from iOS app → web-based MVP
- Vite project scaffolding complete; Tailwind styles integrated
- File structure reviewed (`src/`, `public/`, `css/`); `vite.config.js` and `firebase.json` written and verified
- MemoryBot schema coverage check underway for web-specific event logging
- Upcoming: Automated log write pipeline via `log-server` → GitHub commit or Firestore sync

⛔️ **Blockers**
- ⚠️ Vite build error due to UTF-8 BOM encoding in `postcss.config.cjs` (resolved)
- No automated `/DAA_ProjectLog.md` writer agent yet — manual updates required for now

📌 **Notes**
- All assistant GPTs must check this log **before performing any task**
- If stale (older than 7 days), agents should request an update from Connor
- When automation is implemented, this file will be updated via n8n + GitHub API or Firestore logging bridge
- For file reference consistency: `usersFullTemplate.json`, `Complete User Story Document.pdf`, and `Donna_Brand_Style_Guide.docx` are considered canonical
- UINikki now produces React/Tailwind UI components, not SwiftUI — all layout assumptions must reflect this
- CopyGenie handles web copywriting, CTA phrasing, plan descriptions, and demo language across marketing site and assistant output

## ✅ Project Log Update – June 3 2025

### 🧱 Frontend Framework Progress
- **Core structure completed** for primary screens: `Landing`, `Waitlist`, `Explore`, `Sign-Up`, and `Login`.
- **Landing page** is implemented with base styling and structure; refinement planned for full brand polish.

### 🎨 Theming & Animations
- **Light/Dark theme support enabled** via Tailwind `dark:` classes.
- **Route-level animations active** using **Framer Motion** with smooth transitions between views.
- Theme switching and page transitions are stable with no layout flash.

### 🧭 Routing & Layout
- **Navigation architecture established** with header/footer consistency and clean route logic.
- All route views wrapped in `<motion.div>` for animated mount/unmount behavior.

### 🔐 Authentication Flow
- **UI for Sign-Up/Login is complete** and includes real-time form validation.
- **Firebase Auth backend not yet connected** — pending secure integration and token persistence.
- User stories **US-01** and **US-02** have front-end components finished and are ready for auth linking.

### 🔜 Next Steps
- Integrate Firebase Auth with backend for sign-up/login/reset flows.
- Enhance **landing page visual design** to match Donna’s assistant personality.
- Begin connecting memory, calendar, and list features based on user stories:
  - `US-15` Auto-log reminders/facts
  - `US-18` Natural language event creation
  - `US-26` Custom list creation

### 🧩 Infrastructure Alignment
- Current frontend status aligns with **MVP Phase 2: iOS App MVP**.
- Component structure cleanly matches Firestore schema and expected n8n flow integration.
