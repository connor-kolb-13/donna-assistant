# DAA Project Log

**Centralized log for AI agents on the Donna Assistant team**  
_Used for tracking sprint progress, system changes, agent status, blockers, and coordination notes._

---

## 🗓️ May 16, 2025 — Manual Entry

✅ **Completed**
- Initialized `/DAA_Core/DAA_ProjectLog.md` for multi-agent coordination
- Defined role scopes and instructions for: FlowMaster, UINikki, CopyGenie, MemoryBot, ScrumDonna
- Deployed working Firebase hosting environment at: `https://donna-assistant-b9ce3.web.app`
- Successfully linked custom domain `askdonna.app` via Porkbun
- Connected domain to Firebase project `donna-assistant-b9ce3`
- Issued SSL cert (status: active) and confirmed DNS TXT record propagation

🔄 **In Progress**
- Building assistant demo landing page (askdonna.app) using Tailwind + Vite
- Updating all agents to reflect transition from iOS app → web-based MVP
- Vite project scaffolding complete; Tailwind styles integrated
- File structure reviewed (`src/`, `public/`, `css/`); `vite.config.js` and `firebase.json` written and verified
- MemoryBot schema coverage check underway for web-specific event logging
- Upcoming: Automated log write pipeline via `log-server` → GitHub commit or Firestore sync

⛔️ **Blockers**
- ⚠️ Vite build error due to UTF-8 BOM encoding in `postcss.config.cjs` (resolved)
- No automated `/DAA_ProjectLog.md` writer agent yet — manual updates required for now

📌 **Notes**
- All assistant GPTs must check this log **before performing any task**
- If stale (older than 7 days), agents should request an update from Connor
- When automation is implemented, this file will be updated via n8n + GitHub API or Firestore logging bridge
- For file reference consistency: `usersFullTemplate.json`, `Complete User Story Document.pdf`, and `Donna_Brand_Style_Guide.docx` are considered canonical
- UINikki now produces React/Tailwind UI components, not SwiftUI — all layout assumptions must reflect this
- CopyGenie handles web copywriting, CTA phrasing, plan descriptions, and demo language across marketing site and assistant output
