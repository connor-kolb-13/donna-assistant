# DAA Project Log

**Centralized log for AI agents on the Donna Assistant team**  
_Used for tracking sprint progress, system changes, agent status, blockers, and coordination notes._

---

## 🗓️ May 16, 2025 — Manual Entry

✅ **Completed**

- Initialized `/DAA_Core/DAA_ProjectLog.md` for multi-agent coordination
- Defined role scopes and instructions for: FlowMaster, UINikki, CopyGenie, MemoryBot, ScrumDonna
- Deployed working Firebase hosting environment at: `https://donna-assistant-b9ce3.web.app`
- Successfully linked custom domain `askdonna.app` via Porkbun
- Connected domain to Firebase project `donna-assistant-b9ce3`
- Issued SSL cert (status: active) and confirmed DNS TXT record propagation

🔄 **In Progress**

- Building assistant demo landing page (askdonna.app) using Tailwind + Vite
- Updating all agents to reflect transition from iOS app → web-based MVP
- Vite project scaffolding complete; Tailwind styles integrated
- File structure reviewed (`src/`, `public/`, `css/`); `vite.config.js` and `firebase.json` written and verified
- MemoryBot schema coverage check underway for web-specific event logging
- Upcoming: Automated log write pipeline via `log-server` → GitHub commit or Firestore sync

⛔️ **Blockers**

- ⚠️ Vite build error due to UTF-8 BOM encoding in `postcss.config.cjs` (resolved)
- No automated `/DAA_ProjectLog.md` writer agent yet — manual updates required for now

📌 **Notes**

- All assistant GPTs must check this log **before performing any task**
- If stale (older than 7 days), agents should request an update from Connor
- When automation is implemented, this file will be updated via n8n + GitHub API or Firestore logging bridge
- For file reference consistency: `usersFullTemplate.json`, `Complete User Story Document.pdf`, and `Donna_Brand_Style_Guide.docx` are considered canonical
- UINikki now produces React/Tailwind UI components, not SwiftUI — all layout assumptions must reflect this
- CopyGenie handles web copywriting, CTA phrasing, plan descriptions, and demo language across marketing site and assistant output

## ✅ Project Log Update – June 3 2025

### 🧱 Frontend Framework Progress

- **Core structure completed** for primary screens: `Landing`, `Waitlist`, `Explore`, `Sign-Up`, and `Login`.
- **Landing page** is implemented with base styling and structure; refinement planned for full brand polish.

### 🎨 Theming & Animations

- **Light/Dark theme support enabled** via Tailwind `dark:` classes.
- **Route-level animations active** using **Framer Motion** with smooth transitions between views.
- Theme switching and page transitions are stable with no layout flash.

### 🧭 Routing & Layout

- **Navigation architecture established** with header/footer consistency and clean route logic.
- All route views wrapped in `<motion.div>` for animated mount/unmount behavior.

### 🔐 Authentication Flow

- **UI for Sign-Up/Login is complete** and includes real-time form validation.
- **Firebase Auth backend not yet connected** — pending secure integration and token persistence.
- User stories **US-01** and **US-02** have front-end components finished and are ready for auth linking.

### 🔜 Next Steps

- Integrate Firebase Auth with backend for sign-up/login/reset flows.
- Enhance **landing page visual design** to match Donna’s assistant personality.
- Begin connecting memory, calendar, and list features based on user stories:
  - `US-15` Auto-log reminders/facts
  - `US-18` Natural language event creation
  - `US-26` Custom list creation

### 🧩 Infrastructure Alignment

- Current frontend status aligns with **MVP Phase 2: iOS App MVP**.
- Component structure cleanly matches Firestore schema and expected n8n flow integration.

## ✅ Project Log Update – June 5, 2025

### 🧠 Feature Completion & UX Polish

#### ✨ Memory & Data Settings Page

- Fully built from wireframe and story spec:
  - **Auto-log toggles** (Calls, Tasks) with theme-compatible tooltips.
  - **Personalization level selector** with multi-line contextual help.
  - **Reminder offset input** using branded input styling.
- **Recent Memories viewer**:
  - Searchable, paginated display of logged memories.
  - `Export All` and `Add Memory` controls implemented.
  - Responsive layout and `❓` tooltip replaced with `<FaInfoCircle>`.

#### 🔧 Shared Form Components

- Created reusable components for:
  - `Toggle`, `InputField`, `SelectField`
- Each supports:
  - Light/dark theming via Tailwind's `dark:` utilities.
  - Hover-based info tooltips using Tailwind + group-hover.

---

### 👤 Account Settings Integration

#### 📸 Profile Photo Upload

- Implemented direct photo upload to **Firebase Storage**:
  - User photos saved to `profilePics/{userId}`.
  - URL stored in `users/{uid}/profilePic`.
  - Fully responsive preview and fallback icon if none exists.
- Fixed `403` permissions by adjusting Firebase Storage rules to allow authenticated user access.

#### 🔄 Global Profile Context

- Built `UserContext` with `useUser` hook to centralize user data (name, avatar).
- Now powers Navbar state — user photo/name update immediately reflects after change.
- Used `onAuthStateChanged()` and `getDoc()` to sync user record to app state.

---

### 🧭 Navbar & Navigation

#### 🧱 Structure Rebuild

- Refactored navbar to support authenticated and guest flows:
  - Guests: `Home`, `Explore Donna`, `Join Waitlist`, `Log In`, `Sign Up`
  - Auth Users: `Dashboard`, `Chat`, dropdown with `Settings`, `Billing`, `Help`, etc.
- Added `Home` and `Explore Donna` back into logged-in user dropdown per latest UX review.

#### 📱 Mobile Menu Enhancements

- Dropdown mirror implemented on mobile.
- All routes preserved across devices with consistent dark/light behavior and spacing.

---

### 🧩 Dashboard & Explore Pages

#### 💬 Explore Donna Deep Dive

- Cards added for each assistant feature:
  - `Calendar`, `Email`, `Tasks & Reminders`, `Memory`, `Files`, etc.
- Responsive layout with CTA logic placeholder added for future action buttons.

#### 📌 Dashboard Landing

- Base dashboard page scaffolded.
- Includes routing logic and early contextualization hooks for future assistant-driven modules.

---

### 💄 Styling & Brand Enforcement

- **Polished all route views** with:

  - `motion.div` transitions on mount/unmount.
  - Donna-standard button/input/card classes (`button-primary`, `input-field`, `card-surface`).
  - Branded icons, soft shadows, and responsive spacing throughout.

- **Font + Icon Cohesion**:
  - Inter/Poppins for UI; Open Sans/Roboto for body where applicable.
  - Lucide and Font Awesome used for functional consistency (user icon, info tooltips, etc.).

---

### 🧪 Validation & Error Handling

- Input validation on all forms (login, signup, settings).
- Async loader state on submit and file upload actions.
- Graceful fallback behaviors implemented:
  - Profile image → icon if blank
  - Form errors don’t break layout
  - Image upload shows `Uploading...` CTA on progress

---

## 🔜 Upcoming Priorities

- ✅ Finalize **Account**, **Notifications**, **Privacy & Security**, and **Memory & Data** settings pages
- 🧩 Complete **Integrations** and **Billing** views with placeholder logic for live service data
- 📘 Build out **Help & Support** section with FAQs and feedback form components
- 🧼 Align styling and transitions across all utility pages before chat interface begins
- ❌ Deprioritize core **chat memory/NLU logic** until structural pages are fully done
